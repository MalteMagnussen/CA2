      <h3>SCRUM Plan HTML page</h3>
      <b>Sprint One</b> Friday (04/10 - Monday 07/10):
      <ul>
        <li>The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on
          your deployed project.</li>
        <li>The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can
          either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining
          sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).</li>
        <li>The CI-pipeline must be setup</li>
        <li>Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Sprint Two</b> (Tuesday 8/10 - Wednesday 9/10):
      <ul>
        <li>Most of the Entity Classes should be ready</li>
        <li>Sample data should be available in the dev-database</li>
        <li>Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and
          integrations tests</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Sprint Three</b> (Thursday 10/10- Sunday 13/10):
      <ul>
        <li>Complete the API (as much as you have time for)</li>
        <li>Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at
          least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Get all persons with a given hobby</li>
          <li>Get all persons living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)</li>
          <li>Get the count of people with a given hobby</li>
          <li>Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark</li>
          <li>Get a list of companies with more than xx employes</li>
          <li>Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Complete documentation and prepare for your review presentation after the holiday</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each sprint must end with a (very) short combined sprint retrospective meeting/sprint planning meeting where
        you must demonstrate what you have done/plan to do. This meeting will be online using Flow. 50% of all available
        studypoints for this CA will be given after these meetings, so make sure you all attend, and that you all get
        something to say as for what you have done.
